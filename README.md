# FaceMaskDetector
Face mask detector with Pytorch and OpenCV
The data was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection.
The dataset contains 853 images belonging to 3 classes: with mask, without mask, wearing mask incorrectly.
I used OpenCV Cascade Classifier and Transfer Learning(ResNet 50).
